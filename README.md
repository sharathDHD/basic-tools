# Dashboard Utility

This project is a Python Dash dashboard that provides a suite of encoding, decoding, and hashing functionalities through an interactive user interface.

## Features

1. **Base64 to Image Converter:**  
   Convert a Base64-encoded string into an image.

2. **Image to Base64 Converter:**  
   Upload an image file and convert it into a Base64 string.

3. **MD5 Checksum Generator:**  
   Compute the MD5 checksum of an uploaded file.

4. **Text to MD5 Converter:**  
   Convert input text into its MD5 hash.

5. **Valid MD5 to Text:**  
   Validate an MD5 hash against a predefined mapping and retrieve the corresponding text.

6. **Compare MD5 Hashes:**  
   Compare two MD5 hash values to check for a match.

7. **Check Base64 Type:**  
   Determine if a Base64 string represents an image (JPEG/PNG) or text.

8. **Text to SHA-1 & SHA-256 Converter:**  
   Generate SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes from input text.

9. **Image to SHA-1 & SHA-256 Converter:**  
   Compute SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes for an uploaded image file.

## User Interface

- **Content Cards:**  
  Each functionality is represented by a card in the main content area. Clicking the "Launch" button on a card opens a full-page modal with the tool interface.

- **Modals:**  
  Each modal features a clean, modern design with smooth rounded corners, a light background, and intuitive input elements.
